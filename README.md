# TOEFL House ERP

Owned engineering foundation for the TOEFL House language-institute ERP initiative.
The GitHub repository name remains `TOFEL-House-ERP`.

## Current status

**Placement is CLOSED / QUALIFIED** for the bounded synthetic isolated build
(session branch `arena/01a0a13b-tofel-house-erp`). Hosted run `34932512626`
on commit `4571e6c`: 332/332 native checks, 86/86 runner steps, production
**REJECT**. Do not reopen Placement. See
[PLACEMENT-CLOSURE.md](docs/domain/PLACEMENT-CLOSURE.md) and the
[app boundary](apps/toefl_house/README.md).

**ERP capability review (no new product code):**
[ERP-CAPABILITY-MAP.md](docs/domain/ERP-CAPABILITY-MAP.md) classifies every
major domain as NATIVE, CONFIGURATION, TOEFL HOUSE EXTENSION or DEFERRED.
The strategy remains reuse of Frappe/ERPNext/Education/HRMS. Recommended next
custom domain is a *thin* Admission decision on native Student Applicant — not
a second ERP. Admission is **not started**. Do not deploy.

**Phase 3 domain architecture is ready for review:**
[TOEFL House domain design package](docs/domain/README.md) covers native entity ownership,
placement/admission/academic/finance/HR workflows, permissions, integration boundaries
and the implementation plan.

**Recommendation: REJECT current Phase 2/production acceptance.** Hosted tests verify
controlled web/worker restart and existing security regressions. An isolated frontend
candidate reduces advisory matches from 57 to 23 but is **not adopted**; production
pins remain unchanged and broader operational gates remain open. No TOEFL-specific
implementation is authorized. See the
[final qualification review](docs/engineering/foundation-final-qualification.md) and
[long-term architecture decision](docs/engineering/foundation-architecture-decision.md).

**Phase 2 qualification is incomplete. A clean pinned ERP installation and migrations
have passed on a controlled hosted runner. Product implementation remains blocked.**

The hosted runner resolved the local download/service blocker. Five upstream apps
install and build together, and synthetic academic-to-payment, backup/restore and worker probes passed.
Student REST/private-file isolation failed in the baseline configuration; native
User Permissions corrected those tested paths. The generic guard now has hosted proof
for 47 expanded isolation checks and five browser checks, including CSRF controls.
A later hardened run also passed encrypted-credential and permission recovery, copied-session
revocation, 47 recovered-site checks, and two upstream permission/sharing suites.
These scoped passes do not clear the broader security gate.
Full domain, authorization and payroll qualification is not complete. Frontend dependency advisories remain unresolved; installation and build
success do not establish a working, secure ERP.

## Architecture direction

Select **controlled upstream-aligned maintenance** for Frappe + ERPNext + Education,
with MariaDB by default and HRMS for the justified native HR/payroll scope. Keep current
pins as an isolated qualification baseline; no production risk acceptance is granted.
Contracted, bounded upstream-aligned maintenance is the fallback if feasibility fails—not
a permanent private fork, replacement portal or forced dependency overrides.

Preserve native student, employee, academic and accounting authorities, and keep owned
security safeguards reversible. Placement is the only authorized custom domain and is
closed. Further custom work (thin Admission or anything else) needs explicit
authorization and must follow the [capability map](docs/domain/ERP-CAPABILITY-MAP.md).
English remains canonical; no UI redesign or localization changes are in scope. The
architecture choice is **not** production approval.

The branch-scoped **Foundation runtime validation** GitHub Actions workflow is the
reproducible clean-install qualification runner. It is not a production deployment
or a verified interactive local-development setup. See the validation report for limits.
Do not reopen Placement. Custom finance/HR or a second student lifecycle remain
unauthorized. Production remains **REJECT**.

## Validation utilities

These utilities do not install a site or claim application compatibility:

```bash
python3 tools/foundation/preflight.py --method native --output .foundation/preflight.json
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests/foundation -v
```

Preflight exits nonzero for missing/mismatched prerequisites. See the report for
the integrity-preserving Yarn mirror and explicit dependency advisory commands.
A passing helper test suite is not a passing ERP test suite.

## Contribution and data policy

Use the authorized working branch and reviewed pull requests; do not modify `main`
directly or rewrite history. Keep future customizations in the owned application
and enforce business rules server-side. Never commit real site configuration,
credentials, student/payroll data, database dumps or backups.

No product license has been selected yet. Review the initial assessment's licensing
section before incorporating or distributing upstream software.
